# MIMIC-NLP

This repo outlines how to construct a medical note classifier using data from MIMIC-III and deep learning. Instructions include setting up a MySQL server on Google cloud and populating the server with the data from MIMIC, creating a Jupyter notebook on Google Dataproc for running the code, developing word embeddings using gensim, and finally classification of the documents by type and author using RNN in tensorflow.

# Accessing MIMIC-III
